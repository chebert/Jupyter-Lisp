SCMPY
-----

Scmpy is meant to be a literate, Python based implementation of Scheme.
It's entirely contained in a Jupyter notebook.
It goes out of its way to be human-readable and have examples for all functions.
It includes important Scheme features like reader-macros, macros, tail-call elimination, and a basic compiler.
That said, it isn't meant to be useful as a program, but a demonstration of literate programming.


To run
```python -m notebook```

Open the notebook in a web browser at localhost:8888
