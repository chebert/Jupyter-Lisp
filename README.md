SCMPY
-----

Scmpy is meant to be a literate, Python based implementation of Scheme.
It's entirely contained in a Jupyter notebook.
It goes out of its way to be human-readable and have examples for all functions.
It includes important Scheme features like reader-macros, macros, and tail-call elimination.
That said, it isn't meant to be useful as a program.
